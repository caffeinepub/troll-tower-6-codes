      "reason": "In the visible App.tsx snippet, the only primary CTA shown is labeled \"Get Codes!\" and the diff content is truncated before any section that might render the required \"Get Some Codes\" button; therefore the required exact label/visibility condition cannot be confirmed.",

      "reason": "The App.tsx diff is truncated before any code-reveal UI; while state like `showCodes`/`handleRevealCodes` exists, the rendered three buttons and their exact visible text (and the fact they are hidden until click) are not shown in the provided snippet, so the acceptance criteria cannot be verified from evidence.",
