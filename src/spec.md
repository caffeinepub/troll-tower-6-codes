# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Gate access to code reward buttons behind completing the questionnaire with “Yes” answers and a final “Get Some Codes” action.

**Planned changes:**
- Show a final action button labeled “Get Some Codes” only after the user answers “Yes” to both questionnaire questions.
- On clicking “Get Some Codes”, reveal exactly three buttons with the exact labels: “Sub2AcerXDucky = 4500 Money”, “FunTrollTower6 = 3000 Money”, and “ILoveTT6 = 1200 Money”.
- Ensure the three code buttons are hidden until the user clicks “Get Some Codes”, and remain inaccessible unless both answers are “Yes”.

**User-visible outcome:** After answering “Yes” to both questions, the user can click “Get Some Codes” to reveal three code reward buttons with the specified text.
